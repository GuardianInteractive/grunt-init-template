# aaa_core

Default styles. If your project incorporates several (non-iframed) interactives on the same page, you may prefer to delete this folder.

If it grows large enough, it may make sense to move it into a separate file which can be conveniently referenced from projects.

It is called `aaa_core` so that these files get included first - this allows the default styles to be overridden without selector one-upmanship.
